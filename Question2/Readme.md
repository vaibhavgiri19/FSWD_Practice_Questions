# Event Website Practice Project

This is a **React-based Event Website** practice project. The goal is to create a simple landing page for an event with clear sections, deploy it, and submit it as instructed.

## General Guidelines

- Use **React** (Vite or Create React App) to build the project.
- Structure the page into clear sections:
  - **Header**
  - **Event Details**
  - **Schedule**
  - **Footer**
- Deploy the app to **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
- Add both the **GitHub repository link** and **deployment link** in your `README.md`.
- **Exclude `node_modules`** before submission.
